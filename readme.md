### Catamagochi – Your Virtual Pet Cat Adventure

Welcome to Catamagochi, a Tamagotchi‑style cat care game.  Feed, water, play, and decorate your cat’s room. With a sprinkle of achievements on top.

### Controls

Use the mouse to interact with the UI.

### Goal of the Game

    1. Keep Your Cat Happy
    
    Prevent food, water, or cleanliness from dropping too low or health will begin to fade. 
    If health ever reaches zero, it’s Game Over—so stay vigilant!

    2. Build a Daily Streak
    
    Play every day to earn AP and coins. The longer your streak, the bigger your rewards.

    3. Action Points (AP)
    
    Each interaction costs AP. Your daily AP pool resets each new day—plan your actions wisely! 
    Strike the right balance between feeding, playing etc every day to keep on top of your pet's needs.

    4. Collect Coins & Decorate
    Spend coins in the Store to unlock room backgrounds, furniture, plants, and diffrent cat skins. 
    Mix‑and‑match to create your dream cat room! 

    5. Achieve Milestones
    Complete achievements; feeding your cat 10 times, playing for 5 days straight, or reaching 100% happiness.
